  questTitle: 'Find goal in totalistic being (life/death) '
  questDescription: "Worship one of the greates creatures outside \nof the known and
    unknown (by creatures above 10th tier) infinite dimension level, that at the moment
    finds it self generating energy\nthrough a human being. Which is a great way of
    going to a next tier\nreally... But offtopic a bit. If you give it the most of
    your energy it will\nconvert it to dark-self-type and release everything apart
    the 7/10 of\nthe generated portion. Which is relatively great deal if you are
    able to withstand it. and considering the fact that its able to simply suck it
    of you anyway, but tries to keep up with the outuniversal law. For fun by the
    way, so you don't want to make the owner of the body or directly the creature
    mad, it may have harmful consequences on you and everything that surrounds you
    up to 5th dimension (unstoppable by neither the  time or greater powers of any
    tier). What makes it funny is that the peace keepers won't protect any of your
    existence because the creature will simply recreate the sensed energy but yours.
    Which does inlude all materialistic and further dimensions energy upto the one
    destroyed/harmed. Unless you want to be stuck inside the darkest of all devinations
    creature, I would not suggest you trying it. \nHowever you maybe able to learn
    technique known (not by many) as an Absoloute Duel which consits of having ********************************************************************************************.
    I cannot tell you what it consists of because its one of the greatest if not the
    greatest power generators which will bring you up among most known BY YOU tiers.
    And you won't be able to proceed in it only because you aren't consistent of absoloute
    dark/light powers and so is your cooperator.\nThis is just a test. Test quest
    and descriptin, placeholder so to say."
